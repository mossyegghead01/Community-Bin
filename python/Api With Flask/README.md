# Author Info
Well hello, I'm back, I'm mossy. Previously known as Big Brain Mossy#9139 in python package example, but now just call me mossy or mossy#9999 if you wish to find me on discord.

# Description
This is a simple example of an API made with flask. It is a simple one, but might help you learn something. Once you have the basic understanding about this, you can extends the API to actually process something or adding your own API key for rate limit purpose or perhaps anything you can think what API can do. Please be aware I'm expecting you to at least has basic understanding of flask and how website work (If not just visit flask documentation [`here`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)).

# Dependencies
- [`Flask`](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
- Basically anything else you need for your API, maybe discord.py or something.

# How To use
Just check main.py in this folder, I left some note in there so you know what is part of what. Feel free to add more pages and methods. I left a note specifiying how to.

Now run the file, then go tou your localhost(or where ever is the domain it assigned to) and (only if you use the original code, might be different depending on how you edit the code) you will see that it said Welcome to home. Instead, go to (your-domain)/hello. And what you gonna see depends on what browser you use.

Example in firefox:

Example in chrome:

If what you see is similar with above then congrats, your API is working correctly. Feel free to add more and more thing.

But hey how can I use it? Similar to how you use another API. Maybe you want to use public domain if you want it to be public instead of using your ip or localhost.
